For a website preview, go here: [ACRC Temp Website](https://testweb12mn.herokuapp.com/)

## Summary

ACRC Website is the first Flask website I've ever made.


Their nonprofit organization represents a growing number of homeowners within urban areas that find housing to be a pain,
and therefore, they choose housing arrangements with a group of strangers and friends alike.

I am helping them program their website as they need it: login systems, dashboard representations, and branding disclosure.

## Flask?

Flask integration is neccesary to connect a number of Python-based experiences, ranging from data displayed in charts, 
tables, and more.

As with any ambitious company, they had a large swath of goals, and HTML/CSS is not enough to complete them.

Flask is a little strange, but through clever manipulation of certain elements, it does a reasonably good job.

### Note

Please note that since this does represent a website for an actual legal entity, the license, as well as the publicity of these files,
and their upkeep is all subject to change at any time. It is their property, not mine. 



Thanks! I'll see you again at my next project.
